# Study of Sensitivity and Rankability

## General Start-up Steps
* Read the papers in the papers folder. One is a sensitivity paper that we've written in prior years about ranking vectors (not on rankability). We expect our paper to be different content wise, but you can see an example of what kind of paper we expect to write. The other two papers are our original rankability paper and our latest in submission paper.
* Read the LOP book (coming soon hopefully in PDF form)
* Read through the PDF in docs that details the overall steps we need to implement.
* Fill out https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iMTfkwgNFzNuOY2dCiqhDacfpsjxAI-0F6Ql857YAuU/edit

## TODO
* Sign everyones form for independent study, senior project, etc
* Determine a meeting time next week
* Schedule an introductory meeting with Amy Langville and Tim Chartier
